## About

Solarpy is a simulation of solar system programmed in Python. This project is a work in collaboration with a comrade.

The program allows you to observe the solar system by moving through the space using the keys on your keyboard. You can choose at the launch of the program which planets you want to display and the date on which you want to see them.
When launching the simulation, you are at a distance from the sun that allows you to see the farthest planet. You can then zoom in to display the planets closest to the sun. The size of the planets and the distance between them is proportional to reality. On the other hand, the size of the sun is adapted.


## Prerequisites to launch the program:
  - Pillow (https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html)
  - Numpy (https://pypi.org/project/numpy/)
  - Pygame (https://pypi.org/project/pygame/)
  - pyOpenGL (http://pyopengl.sourceforge.net)
  - Skyfield (https://rhodesmill.org/skyfield/installation.html)
  
  
## Using the program:
  - Run "solarpy.py"
  - You arrive at a parameter window like the one below where you choose the display parameters, the planets you want to display, the start date of the simulation and the speed of its evolution. You can also start the simulation in live by clicking on the button provided for this action.

  - When launching the simulation, a new window opens and the solar system displays with the parameters you specified earlier and a distance from the center sufficient to see the planet furthest from the sun. (Screen shot below)

  - You can then zoom in or rotate around the sun with the keys on your keyboard. (Examples below)
